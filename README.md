Missing primitive stuff you shouldn't need to re-implement yourself. I think
haddocks are pretty self-explanatory. Currently the package includes the
following functionality:

* resizing (with and without distortion, filling with your color of choice
  is supported);

* cropping;

* flipping horizontally and vertically.
